# Sign-Language-Data
Data set of the British Sign Language alphabet used for classification with accompanying CVS File

The data consists of 9600 training images, 960 validation images, and 960 training images.

The CSV contains datapoints for each handsign generated by using Googles mediapipe. The csv file can be used standalone,
for fitting with such algorithms such as KNN. Though the first column should be dropped and isn't reqiured.


Additionallity, the images can be used on their own without the CSV file for training deep neural models.
